## Policies

### Homework

Homework is assigned after every class meeting and is due before the following meeting. It will usually involve reading a few sections from the Dougherty Intro to Econometrics book and then answering 3 quick questions on a Canvas quiz to reinforce your understanding. Homeworks 4, 5, and 8 involve watching a youtube video about programming in R and solving a few fill-in-the-blank programming exercises.

### Classwork

This class is flipped, meaning that every minute of class time is spent in small groups doing classwork (except for classes 1, 12, and 20 which are for the syllabus and exams). Each group will submit exactly one copy of their classwork. You will begin the course being randomized into groups of 3 (rarely 4). You'll keep the same groups for the first 1/3 of the course, after which you'll be randomized into new groups. For the final 1/3 of the course, I'll take requests for who you want your groupmates to be and I'll do my best to fulfill the maximum number of those requests.

Classworks are either a set of analytical math questions or a set of R programming questions. Classworks are assigned at the beginning of each class and they are due on Fridays at 5pm. I will review the answer keys to the previous week's classworks during lab.

### Attendance

Since this class is flipped, your attendance and participation is crucial. So for each class you miss, your final grade will decrease by a letter (reflected on Canvas by a "participation" score). Make-up assignments will be available upon request (a handful of questions from the Dougherty subsection that is relevant to the class that was missed).
