    "text": "1.1 Random Variables\nA random variable is any variable whose value cannot be predicted exactly. A few examples:\n\nThe message you get in a fortune cookie is a random variable.\nThe time you spend searching for your keys after you’ve misplaced them is a random variable.\nThe number of likes you get on a social media post is a random variable.\nThe number of customers who enter a small retail store on a given day is a random variable.\nThe sales revenue at that small retail store on a given day is a random variable.\n\nSome random variables are discrete while others are continuous. What’s the difference? Discrete random variables are counted like the number of M&M’s you have, while continuous random variables are measured like how heavy your bag of candy is. Discrete random variables take on a small number of possible values, while continuous random variables can take on a very large number of possible values.\nOther variables are categorical instead of being numeric. They may represent qualitative data that can be divided into categories or groups. We’ll lump categorical variables in with discrete variables and we’ll explain why toward the end of this course (see Chapter 13: Dummy Variables).\n\nExample: The message you get in a fortune cookie takes on values like “An exciting opportunity lies ahead of you”, which is not numeric, it’s categorical. We’ll therefore label this random variable a discrete random variable.\n\n\nExample: The “time you spend searching for your keys after you’ve misplaced them” takes on values like 3.982 minutes. It’s a value that can be measured precisely instead of counted, so we’d label this random variable a continuous random variable.\n\n\nExercise 1: Is “the number of likes you get on a social media post” discrete or continuous? Is “the number of customers who enter a small retail store on a given day” discrete or continuous? Is “the sales revenue at that small retail store on a given day” discrete or continuous?"

    "text": "1.2 Discrete Probability Distributions\nConsider the discrete random variable “a dice roll”. It could take on values 1 to 6 and if it’s a fair die, it takes on each of those values with probability 1/6. Our notation will be: X is the random variable, \\(x_i\\) is a potential outcome for \\(X\\), and each potential outcome \\(x_i\\) happens with probability \\(p_i\\):\n\n\nTable 1.1: Potential Outcomes and Probabilities for a Dice Roll\n\n\n\\(x_i\\)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\n\n\n\\(p_i\\)\n1/6\n1/6\n1/6\n1/6\n1/6\n1/6\n\n\n\n\nConsider another random variable \\(X\\) as the sum of two dice rolls.

If \\(Y = b_1 + b_2 X\\), then since \\(E[Y] = E[b_1 + b_2 X]\\), we can simplify using the rules above to get: \\(E[Y] = b_1 + b_2 E[X]\\).\n\n\nExercise 4: Imagine you have a social media account where you receive an average of 2 likes per post.

The interpretation is that when t increases by 1, \\(y\\) increases by r%. To include a disturbance term u, you’d do this:\n\\(y = (initial \\ amount) \\ e^{rt + u}\\)\nLet’s take the log of both sides. Recalling that \\(log(a b) = log(a) + log(b)\\), and \\(log(a^b) = b \\ log(a)\\):\n\\(log(y) = log(initial \\ amount) + r t log(e) + u log(e)\\)\nAnd since \\(log(e) = 1\\):\n\\(log(y) = log(initial \\ amount) + r t + u\\)\nIf we let \\(\\beta_0 = log(initial \\ amount)\\), \\(r = \\beta_1\\), and \\(t = x\\), then we get the log-linear simple regression:\n\\(log(y_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + u_i\\)\nAnd since \\(r = \\beta_1\\), the interpretation of \\(\\beta_1\\) is the same as the interpretation for \\(r\\): when t increases by 1, \\(y\\) increases by 100 * r %.\nFor example, if we estimated:\n\\(log(y_i) = 5 + .1 x_i + u_i\\)\nThe interpretation of the .1 would be that if x increases by 1, y is expected to increase by 10%.\nSimulation:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nexponential_growth_data <- tibble(\n  x = 1:100,\n  y = exp(.1 * x + rnorm(n = 100, sd = 1))\n)\n\nexponential_growth_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(se = FALSE)\n\n\n\nexponential_growth_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = lm) +\n    scale_y_log10()\n\n\n\nexponential_growth_data %>%\n  lm(log(y) ~ x, data = .) %>%\n  broom::tidy()\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)   0.177    0.191       0.928 3.56e- 1\n2 x             0.0959   0.00329    29.2   3.73e-50"

So if we estimate the model and get:\n\\[log(y) = .25 + .72 log(x)\\]\nWe’d say that a 1 percent increase in x is associated with a .72 percent increase in y."
